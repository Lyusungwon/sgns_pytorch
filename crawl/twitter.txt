I fully support the President. He is an intelligent ‚ÄúRocky‚Äù. When battered against the ropes, he does not quit and battles until he wins. I love being on his team to make America great again. He and us are our only hope. Please vote Republican. Say no to Pelosi and Schumer.
@PeterMDavies80 @AG_Conservative He did. It's seems AG's media analysis holds that if you don't include all of the President's rambling hedges, you can't quote his central meaning. It's a weird hill to die on, but sometimes we don't pick the hill, the hill picks us.
@realDonaldTrump God bless you mr. President you are so awesome God is on your side and we're all praying for your safety your welfare in your success
Today, the president of our country is an especially giant piece of shit
Knowing Americans however if Trump can get people to buy a wide screen HDTV they couldn't buy before they'll think Trump is a great president.

@slickmoney007 Most people know him as the Vice President which is a pretty silent role behind a president who can't keep his mouth shut. Even a lot of conservatives don't know him outside of his title.
@EasyNetworks I think you might be shocked on Election Day of the results. I think you have of lived in an alternate world about just how strong the Trump support is. There is a lot of people that love this President and I really think that is going to show itself that day
Our President is brilliant, not only in his economic global strategy, but in those he chose to implement it!

Outstanding article on all that is going on behind the scenes w/ #China &amp; #Russia

He thrives on hatred &amp; dividing the country. He is not America's president. He is white male America's president &amp; only supports #Republicans. Hates rest of Americans. #TrumpLiesMatter

@KashJackson2018 @Hoover2Jo @realDonaldTrump I have mixed emotions on this. Congress has had forever to act!  They did not. If President Trump uses Executive Order this will ultimately place it before the Supreme Court for a decision.
Vidyasagar Rao visited #jayalalithaa at #Apollo hospitals on October 1, 2016. Five days later, he wrote to the President stating Jayalalithaa remained sedated while at the hospital.

@PeterMDavies80 @AG_Conservative @maggieNYT Yes. And that style of hedge is a common tactic of President Trump to offer some later wiggle room about his original and central message. He's already affirmed the momentum is the main issue by discussing it first. The second statement is safety hatch in case he's called on it.
@robreiner I wanna bring down the bobble-headed, political, gummy-worm, (number forty-five)  @realDonaldTrump ‚òëÔ∏è Let‚Äôs see if this works. The President stinks so much that @MELANIATRUMP sleeps alone in the opposite wing of the @WhiteHouse cuz she can‚Äôt breathe from his disgusting stench.
The President's words will soon incite the GunShow¬Æ crowd to head for the border and take up arms against the men, women and children of this unfortunate caravan. Armed with shotguns, homemade cannons loaded with glass and their ARs, they'll do his dirty work. #UnlawfulOrders
@realDonaldTrump We support you President Trump
@GardiLeni @LauraLCroft1 @MissTiffanne @Mariah31783961 @MsMollyOregon @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary I agree.  But wanting them to vaccinate does not make it go away. As you are well aware.  Is our President someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in vaccinations? I am not aware.

@realDonaldTrump You ever notice it‚Äôs the same old bots that reply with the same tired crap over and over! It‚Äôs because they have no new ideas to help make and keep America Great! They are the disgrace not this president!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Biden has a very bad temperament, Major anger issues, and is very dangerous. Hard to believe such a violent person was our Vice President at one point!
@jheil the @Lawrence openings should be collected in a bohnd book, gifted to grandchildren when they ask, DT wasn‚Äôt really the president, was he?
That‚Äôs interesting. I found a tweet and RTd it. It seems it failed to show up. It says when Kavanaugh was elevated to SCOTUS his post was empty. President Trump filed it with a woman who happens to be lesbian. And conservative. Ain‚Äôt that a kick in the head, dems?

@dbongino Thank you Mark Levin and Sean Hannity for supporting MY PRESIDENT. I will be voting Republican on Tuesday.
@rezptp @RodriquezKhaliq @RealCandaceO Republicans also care about the environment, voting rights, and discrimination. In fact, I think President Trump stands for all Americans and wants us all to come together as Americans. We actually agree on many things but our approaches may be different.

@realDonaldTrump Get out and vote for less hurricanes-costs in USA on accepting Paris Agreement. Vote Democrats for that to push your President for a new speech in Rosegarden. You the AMERICAN PEOPLE!
@TheLeadCNN @jaketapper Tragic that a president of the USA will stand before the American people and knowingly lie to the public. Trump complained tonight that 2 crazy criminals impeded the Republican momentum for the midterms. No mention of 11 deaths and 15 bombs. Just that these people got in his way.

@Marvin_Beatty @nytimes By law tax returns are protected, even for presidents. Is being curious a good enough reason to ignore the law? This president is not the only one who didn't show them.

I know the left has a very poor acquaintance with history so most liberals will need to look this up, but I think it's time President Trump ordered a modern day version of President Eisenhower's "OPERATION WETBACK." It worked well and had the support of reasonable Democrats.
